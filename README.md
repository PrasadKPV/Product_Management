## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with two main workspaces:

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/      # Express.js backend application
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/     # React frontend application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json      # Root package.json with monorepo scripts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or later) and npm
-   MongoDB (local instance or a connection string from a service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/product-management.git
    cd product-management
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies from the root directory**
    This command will install dependencies for the root, backend, and frontend workspaces.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**
    Create a `.env` file in the `app/backend/` directory and add your MongoDB connection string and a port for the server.
    ```env
    # app/backend/.env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    PORT=5000
    ```

### Running the Application

From the root directory, run the development script:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.
-   The React frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
-   The Express backend will be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port you specified in `.env`).

The frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend, so you're all set to start developing!
